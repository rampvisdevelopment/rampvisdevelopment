### rampvisdevelopment
This is an account to host gists with data for the RAMP VIS project ([rampvis-api](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/rampvis-api), [rampvis-ui](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/rampvis-ui)).

[gist/gists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) is a service github offers to upload one or a small number of files rather than an entire project. 

To create a gist, log into this account. Then go to https://gist.github.com/ and drag the file into the box, alternatively, excplicitly copy the contents of the file into the box. Then select the arrow next to "create secret gist" and select "create public gist". Now the data you uploaded can be seen at https://gist.github.com/rampvisdevelopment, and to get a URL for it, go to the gist, click raw and copy that url. 

To get the latest version of the data if it is updated, remove the characters between "raw" and the file name. Thus,
".../raw/123456789/example.txt" goes to ".../raw/example.txt".
